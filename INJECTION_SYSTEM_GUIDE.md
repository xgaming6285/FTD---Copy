# Lead Injection System Integration Guide

## Overview

The Lead Injection System is fully integrated with the order management system, allowing affiliate managers and admins to automatically inject leads into target websites when creating orders. The system supports multiple injection modes and provides comprehensive tracking and control features.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Backend Integration**

   - `backend/controllers/orders.js` - Order management with injection logic
   - `backend/routes/orders.js` - API endpoints for injection control
   - `backend/models/Order.js` - Order schema with injection settings
   - `injector_playwright.py` - Python script for lead injection

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - `frontend/src/pages/OrdersPage.jsx` - UI for injection controls
   - Order creation form with injection settings
   - Real-time injection status tracking
   - Control buttons for start/pause/stop

## How It Works

### 1. Order Creation with Injection Settings

When creating an order, injection is automatically enabled for all non-FTD leads:

```javascript
{
  "requests": {
    "ftd": 0,
    "filler": 2,
    "cold": 1,
    "live": 1
  },
  "injectionSettings": {
    "enabled": true, // Always enabled
    "mode": "bulk", // or "scheduled"
    "scheduledTime": {
      "startTime": "10:00", // for scheduled mode
      "endTime": "12:00",
      "minInterval": 30, // Minimum seconds between injections (default: 30)
      "maxInterval": 300 // Maximum seconds between injections (default: 300)
    },
    "includeTypes": {
      "filler": true, // Always true
      "cold": true,   // Always true
      "live": true    // Always true
      // FTDs are always manual - never included
    }
  }
}
```

### Random Interval Configuration

When using scheduled injection mode, you can now control the timing between injections:

- **minInterval**: Minimum time (in seconds) between injections (default: 30 seconds)
- **maxInterval**: Maximum time (in seconds) between injections (default: 5 minutes)
- The system will randomly space injections within this range
- Prevents multiple injections from happening simultaneously
- Ensures realistic timing patterns for better bot detection avoidance

#### Example Scenarios:

1. **Fast injection**: minInterval=10, maxInterval=60 (10 seconds to 1 minute)
2. **Slow injection**: minInterval=300, maxInterval=900 (5 to 15 minutes)
3. **Balanced injection**: minInterval=30, maxInterval=300 (30 seconds to 5 minutes - default)

### 2. Injection Modes

#### Bulk Injection

- All leads are injected immediately when started
- Processes leads sequentially with 2-second delays
- Automatic progress tracking

#### Scheduled Injection

- Leads are injected at random intervals within specified time window
- Supports both HH:MM format (e.g., "10:00") and ISO8601 format
- **New Feature**: Configurable minimum and maximum intervals between injections
- Prevents multiple injections from happening too close together
- Ensures proper spacing between each injection with random timing

### 3. Lead Processing Flow

1. **Order Creation**

   - System pulls leads based on requests (ftd, filler, cold, live)
   - Applies country/gender filters
   - Stores leads in order.leads array

2. **Injection Start**

   - Calculate total injectable leads (excludes FTDs)
   - Update injection status to "in_progress"
   - Process leads based on selected mode

3. **Individual Lead Injection**

   - Calls Python script with lead data
   - Script handles proxy configuration and form filling
   - Captures final redirect domain
   - Automatically assigns client broker based on domain

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Tracks successful/failed injections
   - Updates injection progress in real-time
   - Automatically completes when all leads processed

### 4. Client Broker Assignment

The system automatically handles client broker assignment:

- **Domain Detection**: Captures final redirect domain from injection
- **Auto-Creation**: Creates new client brokers for unknown domains
- **Assignment**: Links leads to appropriate client brokers
- **Tracking**: Updates broker assignment counts

## API Endpoints

### Injection Control

- `POST /api/orders/:id/start-injection` - Start injection process
- `POST /api/orders/:id/pause-injection` - Pause ongoing injection
- `POST /api/orders/:id/stop-injection` - Stop injection completely
- `POST /api/orders/:id/skip-ftds` - Skip FTD manual filling
- `POST /api/orders/:id/assign-brokers` - Manual broker assignment

### Order Management

- `POST /api/orders` - Create order with injection settings
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get order details including injection status
- `GET /api/orders/:id/export` - Export order leads to CSV

## Frontend Features

### Order Creation Form

- **Injection Settings Section**
  - Mode selection (bulk/scheduled only)
  - Time range picker for scheduled mode
  - All non-FTD leads automatically included (FTDs remain manual)

### Orders Table

- **Injection Status Column** - Shows current injection status
- **Control Buttons** - Start/pause/stop injection
- **Progress Indicators** - Real-time status updates
- **Broker Assignment** - Manual assignment when needed

### Status Tracking

- **Real-time Alerts** - Success/error notifications
- **Progress Bars** - Visual injection progress
- **Status Chips** - Color-coded status indicators

## Order Schema Updates

The Order model includes comprehensive injection tracking:

```javascript
{
  // Injection configuration
  injectionSettings: {
    enabled: Boolean,
    mode: String, // "manual", "bulk", "scheduled"
    status: String, // "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "failed", "paused"
    scheduledTime: {
      startTime: String,
      endTime: String
    },
    includeTypes: {
      filler: Boolean,
      cold: Boolean,
      live: Boolean
    }
  },

  // Progress tracking
  injectionProgress: {
    totalToInject: Number,
    totalInjected: Number,
    successfulInjections: Number,
    failedInjections: Number,
    lastInjectionAt: Date,
    completedAt: Date,
    brokersAssigned: Number,
    brokerAssignmentPending: Boolean
  },

  // FTD handling
  ftdHandling: {
    status: String, // "pending", "skipped", "manual_fill_required", "completed"
    notes: String
  },

  // Client broker assignment
  clientBrokerAssignment: {
    status: String, // "pending", "in_progress", "completed", "skipped"
    assignedBy: ObjectId,
    assignedAt: Date,
    notes: String
  }
}
```
