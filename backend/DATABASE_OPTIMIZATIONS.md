# Database Optimizations for Handling Thousands of Records

This document outlines the database optimizations implemented to ensure the application can efficiently handle thousands of records.

## Implemented Optimizations

### MongoDB Connection Optimizations
- Increased connection pool size (from 10 to 50) to handle more parallel operations
- Added minimum pool size (10) to maintain ready connections
- Increased socket timeout to 60 seconds for long-running queries
- Added heartbeat frequency monitoring (10 seconds)
- Implemented connection idle timeout management (30 seconds)
- Enabled network compression (`zlib`) to reduce data transfer size

### Database Schema Optimizations
- Added strategic indexes on the Lead model for common query patterns
- Created compound indexes for frequently combined query parameters
- Implemented text indexes with weighted fields for better search performance
- Added unique constraints on critical fields to maintain data integrity
- Added sparse indexes for optional fields to reduce index size

### Query Optimizations
- Replaced standard find queries with aggregation pipelines for complex operations
- Implemented projection to limit fields returned from queries
- Added `.lean()` to read-only operations to skip Mongoose document instantiation
- Implemented efficient pagination with skip/limit
- Added text search capabilities using MongoDB's text indexes

### Batch Processing
- Created utility for batch processing large datasets
- Implemented staggered processing to prevent overwhelming the database
- Added duplicate detection before insertion to prevent conflicts
- Implemented error handling for batch operations

## Maintenance Scripts

### Index Creation Script
- `scripts/create-indexes.js` - Creates all necessary indexes for optimal performance
- Handles existing indexes gracefully
- Provides detailed logging of index creation status

### Performance Monitoring Script
- `scripts/monitor-performance.js` - Monitors database performance metrics
- Displays collection statistics and index information
- Provides recommendations for further optimizations

## Best Practices for Large Datasets

1. **Always use pagination**
   - Limit results to manageable chunks (10-100 records per page)
   - Implement efficient skip/limit with proper indexes

2. **Use proper filtering**
   - Filter data on the server side as much as possible
   - Ensure all filter fields are properly indexed

3. **Optimize read operations**
   - Use `.lean()` for read-only operations
   - Implement projection to limit fields returned
   - Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Optimize write operations**
   - Use batch operations for multiple inserts/updates
   - Consider using bulk operations for related changes
   - Implement proper validation before database operations

5. **Regular maintenance**
   - Monitor database performance regularly
   - Analyze slow queries and optimize as needed
   - Consider archiving old data if necessary

## Future Considerations

For even larger datasets (millions of records), consider:

1. **Sharding** - Distributing data across multiple servers
2. **Archiving** - Moving older records to separate collections/databases
3. **Caching** - Implementing Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
4. **Read replicas** - Separating read and write operations to different servers

## Testing

Before deploying to production, test with realistic data volumes:
- Use the provided scripts to generate test data
- Monitor performance under load
- Adjust indexes and query patterns as needed
