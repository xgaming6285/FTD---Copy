# Client Broker Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor changes the relationship model from:
- Client Networks → Client Brokers → Leads

To:
- Client Brokers ↔ Leads (many-to-many relationship)
- Client Networks serve as intermediaries only (not tracked in permanent records)

## Changes Made

### 1. New Models

#### ClientBroker Model (`backend/models/ClientBroker.js`)
- **New standalone model** for client brokers
- Fields: `name`, `domain`, `description`, `isActive`, `assignedLeads[]`, `createdBy`, `totalLeadsAssigned`, `lastAssignedAt`
- Methods: `assignLead()`, `unassignLead()`, `isLeadAssigned()`
- Static methods: `findAvailableBrokers()`, `getBrokerStats()`
- Includes pagination support and performance indexes

### 2. Modified Models

#### Lead Model (`backend/models/Lead.js`)
**Removed:**
- `clientBroker` (String field)
- `clientNetwork` (String field)  
- `clientNetworkHistory[]` array

**Added:**
- `assignedClientBrokers[]` - Array of ObjectIds referencing ClientBroker documents
- `clientBrokerHistory[]` - History of broker assignments with fields:
  - `clientBroker` (ObjectId reference)
  - `assignedAt`, `assignedBy`, `orderId`
  - `injectionStatus`, `domain`
  - `intermediaryClientNetwork` (ObjectId reference - for session tracking only)

**New Methods:**
- `isAssignedToClientBroker(clientBrokerId)`
- `assignClientBroker(clientBrokerId, assignedBy, orderId, intermediaryClientNetwork, domain)`
- `unassignClientBroker(clientBrokerId)`
- `getAssignedClientBrokers()` - returns array of ObjectId strings
- `getClientBrokerHistory()`

**Removed Methods:**
- `isAssignedToClientNetwork()`
- `addClientNetworkAssignment()`
- `canAssignToClientNetwork()`

#### ClientNetwork Model (`backend/models/ClientNetwork.js`)
**Removed:**
- `clientBrokers[]` embedded array - client brokers are now separate entities
- `activeBrokersCount` virtual (now returns 0 as placeholder)

**Updated:**
- Added comments explaining that client networks now serve as intermediaries only

### 3. New Routes & Controllers

#### ClientBroker Routes (`backend/routes/clientBrokers.js`)
- `GET /api/client-brokers` - Get all client brokers with pagination
- `GET /api/client-brokers/stats` - Get broker statistics  
- `GET /api/client-brokers/:id` - Get single broker
- `POST /api/client-brokers` - Create new broker
- `PUT /api/client-brokers/:id` - Update broker
- `DELETE /api/client-brokers/:id` - Delete broker
- `POST /api/client-brokers/:id/assign-lead` - Assign lead to broker
- `DELETE /api/client-brokers/:id/unassign-lead/:leadId` - Unassign lead from broker
- `GET /api/client-brokers/:id/leads` - Get all leads assigned to broker

#### ClientBroker Controller (`backend/controllers/clientBrokers.js`)
- Full CRUD operations for client brokers
- Lead assignment/unassignment functionality
- Statistics and analytics
- Proper error handling and validation

### 4. Modified Routes & Controllers

#### Lead Routes (`backend/routes/leads.js`)
**Changed:**
- `PUT /api/leads/:id/assign-client-network` → `PUT /api/leads/:id/assign-client-broker`
- `GET /api/leads/client-network-analytics` → `GET /api/leads/client-broker-analytics`

**Updated validation:**
- Now requires `clientBrokerId` (ObjectId) instead of `clientNetwork` (string)
- Added optional `intermediaryClientNetwork`, `domain` parameters

#### Lead Controller (`backend/controllers/leads.js`)
**Replaced:**
- `assignClientNetworkToLead()` → `assignClientBrokerToLead()`
- `getClientNetworkAnalytics()` → `getClientBrokerAnalytics()`

**Updated:**
- `getLeadAssignmentHistory()` - now works with clientBrokerHistory
- Search functionality - removed clientBroker/clientNetwork from text search
- Aggregation pipelines updated for new structure

#### ClientNetwork Controller (`backend/controllers/clientNetworks.js`)
**Removed:**
- `addClientBroker()`
- `updateClientBroker()`  
- `removeClientBroker()`
- Broker wake-up logic from `createClientNetwork()`

**Updated:**
- `getMyClientNetworks()` - removed clientBrokers from selection

#### ClientNetwork Routes (`backend/routes/clientNetworks.js`)
**Removed all broker management routes:**
- `POST /:id/brokers`
- `PUT /:id/brokers/:brokerId`
- `DELETE /:id/brokers/:brokerId`

### 5. Migration Script

#### Migration Script (`backend/scripts/migrate-client-brokers.js`)
- Extracts embedded client brokers from ClientNetwork documents
- Creates new ClientBroker documents
- Updates Lead documents with new relationship structure
- Maintains data integrity during transition
- Provides detailed logging and error handling

**Migration Steps:**
1. Extract embedded brokers from ClientNetwork documents
2. Create separate ClientBroker documents
3. Update Lead clientNetworkHistory → clientBrokerHistory
4. Update Lead assignedClientBrokers arrays
5. Update ClientBroker assignedLeads arrays
6. Clean up old embedded broker data

### 6. Server Configuration

#### Updated `backend/server.js`
- Added ClientBroker routes: `app.use("/api/client-brokers", clientBrokerRoutes)`

## Key Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Client brokers are now first-class entities
2. **Better Scalability**: No more embedded document limitations
3. **Improved Queries**: Direct broker-lead relationships enable efficient lookups
4. **Simplified Logic**: Client networks serve as intermediaries only
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Better tracking of broker performance and assignments

## Migration Required

**⚠️ Important**: Run the migration script before using the new functionality:

```bash
node backend/scripts/migrate-client-brokers.js
```

This will safely transition existing data from the old structure to the new one.

## API Changes Summary

### New Endpoints
- `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/client-brokers/*` - Full CRUD for client brokers
- `POST /api/client-brokers/:id/assign-lead` - Assign lead to broker
- `DELETE /api/client-brokers/:id/unassign-lead/:leadId` - Unassign lead

### Changed Endpoints
- `PUT /api/leads/:id/assign-client-network` → `PUT /api/leads/:id/assign-client-broker`
- `GET /api/leads/client-network-analytics` → `GET /api/leads/client-broker-analytics`

### Removed Endpoints
- `POST /api/client-networks/:id/brokers` 
- `PUT /api/client-networks/:id/brokers/:brokerId`
- `DELETE /api/client-networks/:id/brokers/:brokerId`

## Frontend Updates Required

Frontend code will need updates to:
1. Use new client broker endpoints instead of embedded broker management
2. Update lead assignment UI to work with broker ObjectIds
3. Modify analytics pages to use new broker analytics endpoints
4. Update any references to old clientNetwork/clientBroker string fields
