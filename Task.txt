âœ… IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:

The current implementation allow inject button, add also inject in the orders's page(if the
affiliate manager or admin create an order he should be able to select an option to inject
leads(every lead except FTD is auto filled in the form by the script) or to select "auto inject"(the
same logic but the injection begins either now(bulk injection) or leads are injected from time to
time f.e from 10am to 12am(at random intervals(1 lead at 10:05, other at 11:43)). That doesn't
apply for FTD's, they are always manually filled by the affiliate manage or the admin. If the order
contains FTD's the program continue doing the injection for the other lead roles and when
finished, the affiliate manager or the admin is asked to skip ftd's and fill them later. The order
should contain that information(if the lead injection was successful or not, and if the affiliate
manager or the admin decides to skip the ftd's and fill them later or they are filled).

âœ… Admin should have an option to add client networks and assign them to
specific affiliate manager. Affiliate manager sees these client networks when
making orders. Affiliate manager doesn't have an option to add new client networks, only to
select them. 

âœ… Leads should have a history of assigned client networks and client brokers. If one lead is already
assigned by affiliate manager or admin to client network he cannot be assigned to that specific
client network twice(if exists in one order, he can exist to another, but can't be assigned to the
same client network), but he can on another.

âœ… When making an order either by affiliate manager or admin, only the client network is specified.
The client broker is specified lately when the injection is over(the domain of the final link is taken
and assigned as client broker(manually by the affiliate manager or the admin)).

âœ… One lead can have many client networks and many client brokers(unique). One client network
can have many client brokers. At every injection the system checks if that lead is already
injected at that specific client broker). If is not - proceed with the injection, if it is - the affiliate
manager or the admin is asked to switch the lead or the system auto select). If lead is assigned
to all existing client brokers in the system, the status of the lead is something like "sleep" or "Not
available client brokers", until in the system is added a new client broker, that the lead is not
assigned to.

! Right now client network save info about client brokers, client brokers are assigned to client networks. We don't need to track this, we need to assign client brokers to leads. 1 lead can have many client brokers. We don't care through what client network, the lead has gone through(only the session keeps track of this). The lead record save the data to which client brokers is he assigned. The client brokers records hold info to which leads they are connected. The client networks are something like intermediary.

! For testing purposes the injector py script is configured to fill the form and redirect to "all done" page. This is the respone from starting an injection for a lead in order. The injection isn't completed because the model actually expects a client broker to be assigned to the network. But the client broker shouldn't be assigned to client network. When affiliate manager or admin make an order, f.e 3ftd, 2filler, 3colds, 1live - when the button for the inject is clicked the script begins to process the requested leads(skips the ftds, they are filled manually by the affiliate manager or admin) and fill their information to the form(script doing that). When the form is filled we are redirected to "The form is submitted successfully" page. The script uses a proxy to do this. After successfull fill the script should wait 1 min(after submission the chrome to redirect to the final link) and when the 1 min is expired, the script takes the website's domain where the user(bot) currently is and assign that domain as a client broker's name. Client broker = final link's domain.

ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. Enhanced Lead Model:
   - Added clientNetworkHistory array to track all assignments
   - Added brokerAvailabilityStatus (available/sleep/not_available_brokers)
   - Added sleepDetails for tracking sleep state
   - Added methods for checking assignments and managing sleep state

2. Enhanced Order Model:
   - Added injectionProgress.brokerAssignmentPending flag
   - Added clientBrokerAssignment tracking
   - Enhanced injection settings and progress tracking

3. Enhanced Injection Logic:
   - Checks for duplicate client network assignments
   - Checks available client brokers before injection
   - Puts leads to sleep when no brokers available
   - Tracks injection status per lead

4. New API Endpoints:
   - POST /api/orders/:id/assign-brokers - Assign brokers after injection
   - GET /api/orders/:id/pending-broker-assignment - Get leads needing broker assignment
   - POST /api/orders/:id/skip-broker-assignment - Skip broker assignment
   - POST /api/leads/wake-up - Wake up sleeping leads

5. Frontend Enhancements:
   - Added broker assignment dialog after injection completion
   - Added broker assignment buttons in order actions
   - Enhanced order creation with client network selection
   - Proper handling of injection states and broker assignment

6. Automatic Wake-up System:
   - Leads are automatically woken up when new brokers are added
   - Wake-up function can be called manually or scheduled
   - System tracks which brokers each lead has been assigned to

âœ… FTDs can't have inject, only affiliate manager or admin should have an option to inject a FTD by
manually filling the form.

All requirements have been successfully implemented with proper error handling, validation, and user interface components.
